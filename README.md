## Summary

Overall, there are a few key takeaways from the NYC Citi Bike Analysis.  Peak hours generally align with the M-F work commute, the riders are predominantly men, a majority of rides are under 10 mins, and most riders are subscribers.

To better understand the model in NYC, it would be helpful to visualize age demographics, whether the riders are NYC residents or tourists, and the purpose of each ride (leisure, work commute, etc).

Given the major differences between Des Moines, IA and NYC, it is not recommended to launch this venture in IA without more research of the local population.
